# Social Algorithm

## Overview

This algorithm aims to focus solely on the social connections between students and forming teams based on these
connections. We also aim to reward student self-organization, so students who set up their preferences in such a way
that everyone indicates a preference for other team members are given their desired team composition. Furthermore, more
organized teams are more likely to be assigned to the project that most of their members indicated a preference for.

### Definitions

- *Clique* - A complete sub-graph of the overall relationship.
- *Team Slot* - A "team" to be filled, we start and finish the process with `num_teams` team slots.
- *Fragment* - A clique not big enough to be its own team without merging with other fragments.
- *Available Team* - A team that is (a) not full and (b) not locked.

### Inputs

At a base level, the social algorithm requires the social preferences for all students within a course. If students were
permitted to specify project preferences in the survey associated with the team generation, then these preferences are
also considered.

Before the algorithm begins, the social preferences of all students are compiled into a directed graph with FRIEND and
ENEMY edges. Within the [social graph](./social-graph.md), we then convert this into an undirected graph where only 
edges of an allowed weight are present (in this case it would be Friend-Friend connections).

## Pseudocode

Before the algorithm begins, we define a sequence of constants:
- `max_team_size` - The upper limit for how many students can be within a single team.
- `min_team_size` - The smallest number of students a team should contain by the end of the team generation process.
- `num_teams` - The number of teams to create in total.

### Stage 1: Finding Student Cliques

The first stage of the algorithm finds cliques of students that contain `max_team_size` students.

We then "clean" these cliques, which simply means that only cliques with unique sets of students are included. In this
process, the clique that is discovered first will be given priority.
> e.g. if two cliques [A. B, C] and [B, C, D] are found in that order, then after cleaning this set of cliques, only [A, B, C] will remain.

For each clean clique, we place it into the next empty team slot. As an additional step, we lock these teams so that
they remain unchanged for the est of the process.

### Stage 2: Finding Clique Fragments

The next stage deals with all cliques that contain a number of students that is â‰¤ `min_team_size`. We refer to cliques
of this size as "*fragments*". These fragments are not "cleaned" as described in Stage 1. Even so, a clique will not be
considered if one or more of its members have already been assigned to teams by the team is is being processed.

At a high level, this stage fills remaining team slots with fragments, considering larger fragments before smaller ones.

For each group of fragments with size `f`, we actually place them into empty team slots in order of their
team_suitability_score() (i.e. a fragment with a higher team_suitability_score will be placed into an empty team slot
before a fragment of the same size with a lower team_suitability_score). This does very little when generating teams,
and is only done to support future improvements to facilitate team regeneration using this algorithm. See, when
regenerating teams with peer evaluation data, we'll need to lower the threshold of the [social graph](./social-graph.md)
, meaning that a clique will not necessarily imply a group of students where everyone is explicitly friends with
everyone else, so fragments of the same size are not all the same thing. This is also the reason cliques in this stage
are not cleaned, so that between two cliques containing overlapping members, the better __scoring__ clique is chosen.

Fragments that are exactly the `min_team_size` are also locked to prevent further modification. This is done so no extra
students are not added to organize steams of the minimum team size, either.

**Clause 2.I:** The fragments of size 1 are ignored, even if it means leaving empty team slots.

### Stage 3: Merging Clique Fragments

Next, the algorithm aims to fill the team slots currently containing fragments. This process is fairly simple:

1. Find the largest fragment-containing team (i.e. a team with less than `min_team_size` members at this stage).
2. Find cliques of size `fill_size` and smaller where `fill_size`=`min_team_size`-(size of fragment).
   > All cliques `fill_size` and smaller are considered, but cliques of size 1 are only considered if only cliques of size 1 are present. If larger cliques are available, that will be favoured.
3. Add the clique best suited to join the team (as determined by team_suitability_score) to the team.
4. Repeat Step 3 until the team has `min_team_size` members.
5. Repeat Steps 1-4 until there are no longer any fragment teams.

Note that this process will also fill any empty team slots that still exist due to **Clause 2.I**.

### Stage 4: Place Remaining Students

Stage 4 places any unassigned students into available teams. This uses the "generate with choose" process used in both
the Weight and Random algorithms. This means we define a choose() method that selects a team and a student, and that
student is then added to the team. This process is repeated until there are no available teams or no remaining students.

For the Social Algorithm, we choose the smallest available team and find the student most suitable to join it (as
calculated with team_suitability_score).

### Stage 5: Assigning Projects

Stage 5 only occurs if each team was given an associated project and students could have indicated preferences for these
projects. Its goal is to keep team compositions intact, but reassign teams so they better fit with project preferences.

This works as follows:

1. Sort teams by best social scores (using TeamEvaluation.team_satisfaction score) first so those teams get their
   preferred projects.
   > The reason team satisfaction score is used here is because it is easier to compute when all the teams are created, so it was architecturally a worse option until this stage.
2. Save team compositions as a 2D-list of students.
3. Empty all teams
   > In this step, it okay to empty teams that we locked in Stages 1-2, but is not okay to empty teams that were locked before the algorithm began. Those are preserved.
4. Assign team compositions to Teams, according to project preferences (using. a modified team_suitability_score)
   > Note that because teams are sorted, better teams will get their pick first.
   > The modification made to team_suitability_score is that preference_utility is used instead of social utility.

## Scoring

__**team_suitability_score(team, list of students)**__
This is used many times throughout the algorithm and is calculated as:

- Sum(social utility of adding a 1 student to the team, for each student) / number of students

__**Team Satisfaction**__
See TeamEvaluation.team_satisfaction().

## Limitations

### Unassigned Students

It is technically possible for students to remain unassigned by the end of this algorithms run. Imagine a class of 10
students, where you wish to create 3 teams (`num_teams=3`). This sets `min_team_size=3` and `max_team_size=4`. If there
exist 3 cliques of size 3 (i.e. [A, B, C], [D, E, F], and [G, H, I]) within the class, then they will be found and these
teams will be locked in Stage 2. The 10th student (Student J) would remain outside of a team in this case. Naturally,
this case is unlikely, but it does remain a possibility.

### Group Splitting

This occurs when "almost-cliques" exist. Say 5 friends [A, B, C, D, E] tried to organize to all be friends. For some
reason, Student A forgot to write Student D as a preference and Student B forgot to write Student E as a preference.
Because of the way clique cleaning works, it will identify [A, B, C] and [D, E] as separate fragments. If these
fragments both so happen to be selected to fill empty team slots (i.e. they are the largest), it is now impossible for a
team [A, B, C, D, E] to exist. The algorithm never even performs the comparison required to know that the
fragment [D, E] would fit in really well with the fragment [A, B, C].

### Time Constraints
Although this algorithm usually runs very quickly, there are combinations of constraints that make it painfully slow.

If students can choose 3 friends, implying teams of 4 people each, then in a 200-person class this means we expect
50 (`expected_num_teams=50`) teams. If a user tries to make only 4 (`num_teams=4`) teams for example (since `num_teams`
is significantly lower than `expected_num_teams`) then the algorithm runs extremely slowly (from seconds to minutes).

Ideally we can check to identify if `expected_num_teams` >> `num_teams` then the algorithm can pre-emptively handle this
case in a less computationally intensive way.
